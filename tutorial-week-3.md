I would like to do my tutorial about HTML. At the same time that I am learning I can write so that way I will review 
whatever I learn new everyday this week.
Today was basics like elements in HTML. 
How to start:
<!DOCTYPE html> were we inform the the browser that we are using the last version of html and the begining of the document.
<head> will be the next element and it identifies the top of the document including the metadata and it may include a document title.
