Week 5.

We did a good job working with jQuery. We have interesting lectures and much more.

Last week we learnt about APIs. 
We were talking about URIs, in the case of the base of URI for the Github API would be `https://api.github.com`.
For the octocat would be `https://api.github.com/octocat` and mine URI for the github API would be `https://api.github.com/users/rosalsm`.

They are 3 ways of authentication that github API support
1. basic aut. (user name and password). It is http://username:password@api.github.com/
2. 0Aut (token based and request a parameter)
3. 0Aut2 (with token too)

What are the HTTP verb that API support?
GET. fetching data from API
POST. Creating data in the API
PUT. Creating or replacing data in the API
DELETE. Removing data from the API
HEAD. Getting just http header info.
