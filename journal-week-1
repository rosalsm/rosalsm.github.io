Week 1.

We have learn a lot, we have struggled a lot too but we are still in here and looking forward.

I learn about Git, github, JavaScript and thinking out of the box. I am getting close of understanding 
the way of thinking and facing the problems or situations where you are not comfortable with.

We learn about functions and how they work, about arrays and how we can work with them and we are still `playing` 
with setting the test to check if our code works. Pretty amazing and confusing at the same time.
