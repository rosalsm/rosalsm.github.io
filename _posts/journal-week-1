Week 1.

We have learn a lot, we have struggled a lot too but we are still in here and looking forward.

I learn about Git, github, JavaScript and thinking out of the box. I am getting close of understanding 
the way of thinking and facing the problems or situations where you are not comfortable with.

We learn about functions and how they work, about arrays and how we can work with them and we are still `playing` 
with setting the test to check if our code works. Pretty amazing and confusing at the same time.

I have learnt about git and how to send my changes in files from local to remote with commands (add, commit and push)
and the opposite when I need to start working with the files from remote to local (pull). Still tricky for me however 
I can see improvements.

I have learnt about JavaScript and its 4 primitive types (null, boolean, numbers and strings) and 2 contents (list or arrays
dictionary as an object) and lots of tools to play with them.

I learnt how to start thinking in order to solve a problem with code. Think about what variables to used, how and how to 
get them related to the function.

Now I have to share this with 2 more people.
