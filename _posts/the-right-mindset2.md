According to Dweck, we can find two types of individuals:

Fixed mindset. Individuals who believe their success is based on innate ability; these are said to have a "fixed" theory of intelligence.

Growth mindset. Who believe their success is based on hard work, learning, training and doggedness are said to have a "growth" or an "incremental" theory of intelligence

Individuals may not necessarily be aware of their own mindset, but their mindset can still be discerned based on their behavior.

It is especially evident in their reaction to failure: Fixed-mindset individuals dread failure because it is a negative statement on their basic abilities. Growth mindset individuals don't mind or fear failure as much because they realize their performance can be improved and learning comes from failure.

These two mindsets play an important role in all aspects of a person's life. Dweck argues that the growth mindset will allow a person to live a less stressful and more successful life.

Individuals with a "growth" theory are more likely to continue working hard despite setbacks.

That is very important in some situations for example, children given praise such as "good job, you're very smart" are much more likely to develop a fixed mindset, whereas if given compliments like "good job, you worked very hard" they are likely to develop a growth mindset. In other words, it is possible to encourage students, for example, to persist despite failure by encouraging them to think about learning in a certain way.

I would like to think that I am part of the growth mindset theory, however I guess it is just matter of discipline, sacrifice and determination. Those skills we have to teach the new generations for a better future of self improvement and learning with no limits.
