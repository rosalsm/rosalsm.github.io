###Describe the MVC pattern of software design, as you understand it.

Model-View-Controller is a software for implementing interfaces. Basically the process works giving feedback 
from the user to the controller in order to improve whatever they are working on.

      user uses the model, 
      controller manipulates the process making changes, 
      the model is updated and goes again to the user for more feedback


###Explain the principle of Encapsulation and give some examples from your own code.

Encapsulation is the process of packing of data and functions into a single component, that way we can hide
and protect the information and code inside the component from external actions.


###How does scoping work in JavaScript programs? How do the function and var keywords affect it?

Scoping is the process of determine the area of application of the variable. 
Local variable, it will be created inside the function and it can be use only inside this function.
Global variable, it is created outside the function and it can be used anywhere in the script.
