What happen in week 3 stays in week 3 and move on.

I think I am talking about new skills every week, I think I am talking about fail and fail and try again. 
Learn fast, think faster and respond even faster even when you have no answer. 
Or maybe you don't think you have an answer but at least you have something to 
say at this point or you know what you can get an easy and fast answer.

This week we learnt CSS, really? I think so. My projects weren't that pretty or perfect but 
I definetely I understood some concepts and I learnt that, at least in CSS, is better start 
from the big picture, the body. After that we can go for the smaller elements.

We started making website responsive to the view ports changing to mobile and tablet view. That was impressive!

This week is getting better and better. I love CSS and I love github and I promise I haven't been drinking. When you see things working you feel like a rock star!!!! I am sorry it is 10:17pm I think I can't write anything better.

Skitch, merged confilcts in github, pseudocoding,etc
