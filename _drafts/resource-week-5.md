There is a very good web site about css and HTML by Shay Howe who will be in the open sources meeting in Raleigh at the end of this month. It is a good guide, organized, easy to understand and clear. Highly recommended.

I am writing my tutorial about CSS selectors and this web is fun and useful at the same time for css selectors.
