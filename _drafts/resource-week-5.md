There is a very good web site about css and HTML by Shay Howe who will be in the open sources meeting in Raleigh at the end of this month. It is a good guide, organized, easy to understand and clear. Highly recommended.

I am writing my tutorial about CSS selectors and this web is fun and useful at the same time for css selectors.

For today, I would like to recommend a link to MDN. I am not very fan of this web for basic guide (I am sure it is great for professionals but right now I normally have to complement MDN with another source). However this time, I have to say it is very clear, easy and fast to get the info, enjoy!
