Week 7.

Last week we covered a lot of concepts and we review another bunch.
We added media query to everything! All projects have to be responsive in mobile, tablet and desktop port views.
We analize the difference between responsive (when really you can see your elements in your html file changing 
accordingly in the process of decreasing or increasing the view port width) and adaptive (when simply you have 3 
posible options for your file html on desktop view, tablet view and mobile view)

We learnt about imperative programming (we tell the computer what to do) and declarative programming (more powerful 
and better. We ask the computer to do something and the computer figure out how to do it)

Angular/dependency injection


Team groups and leadership.

Git flow.


Command (alterate the state/return nothing) and Query (alterate nothing/ return value)

Merge conflicts are not that bad eventually
