Week 7.

Last week we covered a lot of concepts and we review another bunch.
We added media query to everything! All projects have to be responsive in mobile, tablet and desktop port views.
We analize the difference between responsive (when really you can see your elements in your html file changing 
accordingly in the process of decreasing or increasing the view port width) and adaptive (when simply you have 3 
posible options for your file html on desktop view, tablet view and mobile view)

We learnt about imperative programming (we tell the computer what to do) and declarative programming (more powerful 
and better. We ask the computer to do something and the computer figure out how to do it)

Last week experience with team leaders was more having a team leader than being a team leader. Specially because my turn for the role was on Thursday and everyone leaves earlier and it is normally a more relaxing day. I didnâ€™t do that much except for searching about API in Etsy and Postman and asking my team in Slack if they needed something. More or less the same for the weekend
In general, the experience of group work was nice and productive for my team. Communication is important and we cover that I think. Probably more real team work, physically located together could be better but we kept the communication running through Slack pretty well.

Git Flow
Is a branching model for Git that helps you to work in teams managing the different branches that the group use.
The most remarkable advantage is making parallel development very easy isolating the new development from finished work. New development is done in new feature branches and is only merged back into the main branch when the code is ready.

Dependency injection.
In Angular we can use components as services or directives and define them by injectable factory method as dependencies. We can use controllers (constructor function) and inject them with a service or value component as a dependencies


Command (alterate the state/return nothing) and Query (alterate nothing/ return value)

Merge conflicts are not that bad eventually
