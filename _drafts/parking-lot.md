In this file I would like to write about my last week.

Probably the first week where I see more of my weakness.

I have some trouble approaching  the assignment. Maybe I need to work in thinking about what do I need to do first, 
second and third before I start doing anything at all.

Some confusion with variables, what do I need to use in order to get the results and defining the variables.

Thinking about what is the assignment asking for and looking for the big picture ( p.e. submit button in 
MultiColumnForm)

Being comfortable with try/fail process and understanding what the developer tolls is giving me back. 
Basically try try and try.

Thinking about what was wrong and change it for something different, just one thing at the time other wise 
I don’t really know what was wrong.

Frustration is not the answer for anything. It is actually the opposite! Frustration doesn’t allow you to 
think properly and you can’t go forward, waisting time and effort and returns even more frustration!!!!!

Approach the problem on another way, look for help and join someone in the same situation could help and it 
returns mental sanity.


Probably some review the concepts and some JavaScript basics can help too and 20minutes/day of the return of the 
NestedAccordion and friends will be a good options for improvement.


Wed September 16.

It is week 2 and a half. If I think about that it scares me. 

We have a lot to do and I don’t really think I learn that much but I really did. The reason of that feeling is the way of learning. We have touched a lot of new concepts and none of those in a deep way. It seems like I have some idea of how DOM works or how JavaScript modifies the document but I don’t know if this is enough to solve my own problems in real life and work. Maybe not, but tt is a good starting point, it is week 2 and a half anyway.  I had nothing to compare. I never learnt that way before but anyway, we have several more weeks to go.

We are adding now files in HTML for mobile, tablet and desktop, what? yes! I don’t know how to do it yet but I am sure that we’ll figure it out. 

CSS is getting more complicated and interesting. I can decide whatever I want to add a new text line or the color or size of the text. The boxes and other properties are still a little blurry however after today’s assignment, I will be more familiar with that. 

As usual, if you get your hands dirty, in the process of cleaning, you will learn the most.
