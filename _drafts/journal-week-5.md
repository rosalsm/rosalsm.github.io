Week 5.

We did a good job working with jQuery. We have interesting lectures and much more.

Last week we learnt about APIs. 
We were talking about URIs, in the case of the base of URI for the Github API would be `https://api.github.com`.
For the octocat would be `https://api.github.com/octocat` and mine URI for the github API would be `https://api.github.com/users/rosalsm`.

They are 3 ways of authentication that github API support:

1. basic aut. (user name and password). It is  `http://username:password@api.github.com/`

2. `0Aut` (token based and request a parameter)

3. `0Aut2` (with token too)

What are the HTTP verb that API support?

GET. fetching data from API

POST. Creating data in the API

PUT. Creating or replacing data in the API

DELETE. Removing data from the API

HEAD. Getting just http header info.


Last week wee learnt that an API endpoint is any URL that an API understands.
The DOM is an API and a software is what we process in programming since the most simple calculator to the biggest complex code.

We touched some concepts such as promises in jQuery.ajax()

Last week we talked about minification also. Magnification is the fact of removing all of unnecessary spaces and carriage returns. As a result we have smaller files and faster downloads however we have to use regular spaces to read those files properly at human eye so before we read them, we translate them to regular files. Websites using jQuery usually use the min.js version to reduce download speeds.
