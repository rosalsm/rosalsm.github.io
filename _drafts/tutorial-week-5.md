My tutorial this week it will be about CSS selectors

###The most important and useful CSS selectors are:

#### `A`

Selects all elements of type A. Type refers to the type of tag, so `div`, `p` and `ul` are all different element types.

#### `#id`

Selects the element with the `id` attribute. You can also combine the ID selector with the type selector.

#### `AB`

Selects all `B` inside of `A`. Here `B` is the descendant element, meaning an element that is inside of another element.

#### `#id A`

You can combine any selector with the descendent selector.

#### `.className`

The class selector selects all elements with that class attribute. Elements can only have one ID, but many classes.

#### `A.className`

You can combine the class selector with other selectors, like the type selector.

#### `A,B`

This will select all `A` and `B` elements. You can combine any selectors this way, and you can specify more than two.

#### `*`

You can select all elements with the universal selector!
