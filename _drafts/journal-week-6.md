Last week we started with the chessboard, which  it was our big assignment for the weekend. David explained to us 
how to  pay with the jQuery part proper and more effectively. It was pretty interesting to see how all the pieces 
in my mind were starting to get closer.

We talked about the rule of reference of transparency. It means that any 2 values that are exactly equivalents can 
be exchange.

We learnt about Encapsulation (big word for a big meaning) and IIFE (globals) and we use it for defense, making 
easier to read code and working with teams.
