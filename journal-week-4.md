Last week, last week. A lot of ups and downs last week. 

I was very happy understanding CSS and getting results from the page. Colors, font styles and boxing contents, 
that was fun until it gets complicated with links and grids that open and closed and lists that you need to reorganize all elements. 

I have some merge conflicts last week too, at the end and after following some directions, I solved them with no huge problems. 
It gives you an enormous level of satisfaction when finally you can solve your own problems,. Get your hands dirty and once they are very messy, you can figure it out.

Now we are putting almost all the pieces together, HTML, CSS and JS together and it looks very cool!!

At the same time, we have sad news. Emily is not coming back, she left the program. That was the saddest part of the week.
