Last week, last week. A lot of ups and downs last week. 

I was very happy understanding CSS and getting results from the page. Colors, font styles and boxing contents, 
that was fun until it gets complicated with links and grids that open and closed and lists that you need to reorganize all elements. 

I have some merge conflicts last week too, at the end and after following some directions, I solved them with no huge problems. 
It gives you an enormous level of satisfaction when finally you can solve your own problems,. Get your hands dirty and once they are very messy, you can figure it out.

Now we are putting almost all the pieces together, HTML, CSS and JS together and it looks very cool!!

At the same time, we have sad news. Emily is not coming back, she left the program. That was the saddest part of the week.


More info about last week. More merged conflicts and changing files. I think we touched something of JQuery but I really didnâ€™t know what. I had to return to that for sure it will be very helpful for me in order to remember JavaScript. 

Talking about JS, last week finally I had the change to review some JS exercise from the previous week and It was really useful. I was thinking about the process of the event in the element and how to target the element and add an event listener for that. I think it is time for me to approach this issue by myself and move forward to this fear of the JavaScript.

I asked Karlo about his beautiful code in the VIewModeSwitch and everything was clearer and I spoke with Kelly about what I was thinking the process of the event and triggers and function was, she told me I was right and in the right path. That is great but I am still struggle with JS and jQuery. Just keep swimming and keep your ears and eyes open for all this new information. Connections are going to happen sooner or later and I have to be ready for that and catch the bus before is leaving without me.

I would like to write about what we did today instead of last week just for one day. 
This week we are learning about APIs and jQuery and ajax and chessboards again. 
The day was a little different today, we went to a field trip. We went to a local company, located in downtown Durham and with a really good projection for the future. It is called Validic and the CTO and co-founder gave us a tour of his company and its new and impressive location, 12th floor in the tallest building in downtown Durham. We talked about the company and what they were looking for when they hire new developers. They pay close attention to people who can work in groups and they always looking for developers with passion for what they are doing. It sounds very interesting and exiting!
When we came back from the field trip, David did the assignment review and it turned into a lecture about APIs, dictionaries, how to approach to write code and local scope variables. I really enjoyed this afternoon and the day in general. It was a very good day to remember in my learning path and thoughts for the future.
