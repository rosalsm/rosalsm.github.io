In this file I would like to write about my last week.

Probably the first week where I see more of my weakness.

I have some trouble approaching  the assignment. Maybe I need to work in thinking about what do I need to do first, 
second and third before I start doing anything at all.

Some confusion with variables, what do I need to use in order to get the results and defining the variables.

Thinking about what is the assignment asking for and looking for the big picture ( p.e. submit button in 
MultiColumnForm)

Being comfortable with try/fail process and understanding what the developer tolls is giving me back. 
Basically try try and try.

Thinking about what was wrong and change it for something different, just one thing at the time other wise 
I don’t really know what was wrong.

Frustration is not the answer for anything. It is actually the opposite! Frustration doesn’t allow you to 
think properly and you can’t go forward, waisting time and effort and returns even more frustration!!!!!

Approach the problem on another way, look for help and join someone in the same situation could help and it 
returns mental sanity.


Probably some review the concepts and some JavaScript basics can help too and 20minutes/day of the return of the 
NestedAccordion and friends will be a good options for improvement.
